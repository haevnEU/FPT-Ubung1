Sunday Morningly Release Build 1.1 (14 Mai 2017 6:00 uhr)Optimizations:
-Added play and pause symbols to the play/pause button.
-put the EventHandle methods in the controller class in the right order (to make the code nicer and easier to understand, this doesn't change the functionality).

Fixed:
- 'Open Files' button from the main menu actually adds files to the playlist now :D
- added an MP3 Extention filter for the added files.
- user can add multiple files now.
- menuItemLoadEventHandler method doesn't throw an Exception, if the user didn't choose any files to add.
